# EXOZIPPy
initial commit for EXOFASTv2 python translation
This will eventually be a python implementation of EXOFASTv2, but is a long ways off

When we have a functional stub, it'll be a pip installable package. For now, install it like this:

git clone https://github.com/jdeast/EXOZIPPy.git
pip install .

EXOZIPPY_PATH environment variable?
