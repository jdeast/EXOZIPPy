# Testing conventions

Tests follow AAA (Arrange / Act / Assert) with Given/When/Then docstrings. All tests that use `System` must call `system.prepare()` before `system.build_model()`. RA/Dec user params are in **degrees** (the default unit); `Parameter.__post_init__` converts to radians internally.

Do not start the full suite with a timeout. Start it and poll.

Testing note: build relation inputs with `pt.dscalar`, **not** `pt.as_tensor_variable(<python float>)` -- pytensor autocasts a bare Python float to the smallest dtype that represents it (5778.0 -> float32), and a unary op like `pt.log10` on it then computes in float32, silently losing ~1e-7. The model always feeds float64. `tests/test_torres.py` pins the port against real IDL output from `massradius_torres.pro`.

## Suite runtime and the pytensor compile cache

The suite runs in **~8 minutes warm** and **~25 minutes cold** (`-n 6`, 2473 tests). A cold
run happens once per fresh checkout or worktree, and on CI until its compiledir cache is
populated. The runbook -- what the cache is, how it is bounded, how to reclaim space, and
how to measure a run honestly -- is in `docs/testing-cache.md`. Read that before changing
anything about the compile cache or the suite's timing.

Two claims that used to live in `CLAUDE.md` are wrong and are recorded here only so nobody
reintroduces them:

- "The test suite takes ~10 minutes." Superseded by the measured numbers above.
- "`poetry run pytensor-cache cleanup`" as the remedy for a compile-cache-induced pytest
  Timeout. The diagnosis of the Timeout is right; the remedy is not. `pytensor-cache
  cleanup` only deletes entries older than 31 days and provably does nothing here
  (measured 4035 -> 4034 entries, 4.1 G -> 4.1 G).
