# Brainstorming Ideas for EXOZIPPy

## Microlensing Events w/RV Data

JDE is focused on getting RV working. JCY is focused on getting MM working. 
Eventually, the goal is to integrate them into the same, universal planet-fitter.
The intersection of these efforts is microlensing events with RV data. There are
two. JCY published one and JP Beaulieu published the other.

## Microlensing Events w/Eclipses/Transits?

Low-priority because we can't think of an actual science case. It's just a fun
edge-case.

There are microlensing lightcurves that also show eclipses (for an eclipsing 
binary). JCY thinks the example she knows of (KB23-2027) has an eclipsing 
binary source.
